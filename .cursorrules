# 🎌 CYOA MLOps Project - Cursor Rules & Context

## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is an anime-inspired Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) story generator using MLOps best practices.
- **Goal**: Build an AI story generator with proper MLflow tracking and version control
- **Tech Stack**: Python, MLflow, GPT-2, Transformers, Jupyter, Git
- **Environment**: Windows PowerShell, virtual environment `story_mlops_env`
- **User Level**: New to ML but learning step-by-step with educational explanations

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS (January 1, 2025)
- ✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETE**: Data Infrastructure & MLOps Setup
- 🔄 **Phase 2 IN PROGRESS**: ML Model Development (just completed first experiment)
- **Current Achievement**: Successfully ran first GPT-2 inference experiment
- **Active Services**: Jupyter (localhost:8888), MLflow UI (localhost:5000)
- **Git Status**: Connected to https://github.com/jaidenschembri/cyoa.git

## 📊 COMPLETED WORK
### Data & MLOps Infrastructure:
- ✅ Virtual environment setup with all dependencies
- ✅ 5 anime-inspired CYOA scenarios in `data/story_dataset.csv`
- ✅ Data preprocessing pipeline with MLflow logging
- ✅ MLflow experiments: `cyoa_data_versioning` (data) & `cyoa_model_experiments` (models)
- ✅ Comprehensive progress tracking system (README.md, PROGRESS.md)

### ML Model Experiments:
- ✅ First GPT-2 baseline experiment completed successfully
- ✅ Generated 5 story responses and compared to human-written versions
- ✅ Results saved to `generated_stories_baseline.csv` and MLflow artifacts
- ✅ Model pipeline: data loading → GPT-2 inference → evaluation → MLflow logging

## 🤖 ML EXPERIMENT RESULTS
**GPT-2 Baseline Performance:**
- Generated stories for all 5 genres (fantasy, magic_school, slice_of_life, gaming_isekai, time_loop)
- **Key Observations**: Model generates coherent text but lacks anime-specific context
- **Issues Found**: Repetitive patterns, not CYOA-formatted, generic responses
- **Next Steps**: Fine-tuning needed for anime storytelling style

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. **Analyze ML results** in MLflow UI at http://localhost:5000
2. **Document experiment findings** and update progress tracking
3. **Plan fine-tuning approach** for anime-specific content
4. **Expand dataset** with more anime scenarios (target: 15-20 stories)
5. **Experiment with prompt engineering** for better CYOA format

## 🧠 USER LEARNING PROGRESS
**ML Concepts Mastered:**
- ✅ Pre-trained models and inference
- ✅ MLflow experiment tracking and artifact logging
- ✅ Model evaluation basics
- ✅ Data preprocessing pipelines
- ✅ End-to-end MLOps workflows

**Ready to Learn Next:**
- Fine-tuning vs transfer learning
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Advanced evaluation metrics
- Model deployment concepts

## 💬 COMMUNICATION STYLE
- **Use brief educational comments** in code (don't over-explain)
- **Explain ML concepts** as we implement them
- **PowerShell commands only** (Windows environment)
- **Show comparisons** between human vs AI outputs
- **Track everything** in MLflow for professional MLOps practices

## 🚨 IMPORTANT CONTEXT
- User is building this for **portfolio/learning purposes**
- Emphasize **MLOps best practices** throughout
- Keep **anime themes** consistent (references to series like Wandering Witch, Clannad)
- **Progress tracking** is crucial - update PROGRESS.md regularly
- **Git commits** should follow conventional commit format

## 🔄 ACTIVE SESSIONS
- **Jupyter Server**: http://localhost:8888 (running)
- **MLflow UI**: http://localhost:5000 (running)
- **Virtual Environment**: story_mlops_env (should be activated)
- **Working Directory**: C:\Users\jaide\OneDrive\Desktop\cyoa-mlops

## 📝 RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS
**Latest Session (Jan 1, 2025):**
- Successfully completed first ML inference experiment
- GPT-2 model (117M parameters) loaded and used for story generation
- All 5 anime prompts processed with side-by-side human vs AI comparison
- Results properly logged to MLflow with parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Ready to analyze results and plan next experiments

Remember: User is new to ML but learning quickly. Always explain the "why" behind technical decisions while maintaining momentum toward the end goal of a production-ready anime story generator.
