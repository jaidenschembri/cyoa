"You arrive in Pine Hollow as fog rolls through the towering pines, here to investigate the disappearance of Sarah Chen","Sheriff Morrison greets you at the town limits, his weathered face unreadable. 'Detective, welcome to Pine Hollow. Coffee's fresh at Marge's Diner, and the station's just down Main Street. Hope you're ready for this one.'","The detective's face turns to stone. 'It's true it's, and it's being investigated. I just wish I could get you some coffee at least once today, but if you're not, I'm not sure that I will have much of an option.' You smile. 'But you know, I'm a detective at heart, and I'm interested in finding out what's going on.' You nod in agreement. 'I can see that you can come back on Wednesday in one of our two large coffeeshops for a break when the morning lights come on. I'm sure you can find something useful.' The detective laughs. 'I'm glad you're looking forward to it, and would you like some of your friends to come back with you?' 'Yes,' you say with a grin. 'I'd like to join you at the Coffee Shop, but if you'd like to show your good hand, I'll be in person soon.' After a few minutes of chatting and greeting, you head into the back of the station. 'You have the option of leaving it for me, but I'm very curious, and we should take advantage of the fact that our first interview is scheduled for tonight. The other two will be here in just a moment,",sheriff_path,twin_peaks,straightforward_caring,Head straight to the diner to gather local intel,Go to the sheriff's station for the official briefing
"At Marge's Diner, the locals fall silent as you enter, their conversations dying mid-sentence","Marge wipes down the counter with practiced ease, her smile warm but her eyes watchful. 'Coffee, Detective? The cherry pie's fresh today, made it myself this morning. Though I suppose you're here about poor Sarah, everyone's been talking about it.'","She nods, trying to keep her face neutral, making you feel like she has forgotten which one she has. 'I remember being that sort of girl, like I always used to be. So, I guess I'm just here to tell you something I thought I'd forgotten.'""

Pressed further, in more awkward silence.

""Why am I here?"" asks the detective, now fully aware. ""You think I'll just ignore you? Just be yourself. It'll be alright. Well, yeah, I suppose you'll be my little girl, for sure. Well. Here we go for now. Just remember to shut up, Detective.""

You nod at her, wondering why her eyes are already closed, but she doesn't answer.

""I just… I didn't think you thought of that… 'cause I'm not good at this…""

Pressing on one of those things, you'll find yourself in a conversation with the other detective who's been dealing with her this whole time, not knowing what to do. One of those things you always find yourself saying in public, but only if the other detective takes care to make it clear to you that she has to keep this quiet. Something.

The forest path behind Sarah's house leads into dense woods where the shadows seem to move,"Ancient Douglas firs tower overhead, their branches creaking in the wind. You notice broken twigs and strange markings on the bark, as if something large passed through recently. The air smells of pine needles and something else... something you can't quite place.","The Forest in Seattle: What a quiet place. I want to see if you want to see it yourself

The Sound of the Forest: A distant dream is suddenly clear through the trees. Something about the sound of the forest and the bright colours and the music is suddenly out of place, but it is still there. I know I am on the same wavelength from the rest of you. I know I am able to see some interesting things.

The Forest in Seattle: The forest is a strange place. That seems to matter a lot, but it is also an important forest. I wish that you were here. If there is a forest in Seattle that is as open to the public as it is, then why the forest in Seattle? And just for a minute, I just wanted to be there.

The Sound of the Forest: Well, I really don't understand the sound, but there's something wrong with it. The sound isn't there. I have nothing to say about that.

The Forest in Seattle: I like listening to your music. I know I love that sound, but I can't understand you.

"Sheriff Morrison's office feels stifling, old case files stacked high on metal shelves","The sheriff pours black coffee from a pot that's seen better days. 'Sarah Chen, 28, librarian. Disappeared three nights ago. No signs of struggle, no note. It's like she just... vanished. Hell of a thing, Detective.'","He turns back to the page. 'What do you think your daughter is doing?' he asks. 'Do you have any idea what her identity is?' He pauses, and pauses until he feels the words, 'Sarah Chen, 28, librarian.' He turns away to check that the case has been cleared of waste. The page is cluttered, and the desk has been smashed. The sheriff's office has been raided. A police van has been stationed outside the courthouse. A man in a high-collared black hooded jacket and black hat, just like his mother, is the only witness. The deputy's uniform is plain. His face has been carved out, his hair tied back, and his mouth curled into a frown. His eyes are blank, and his face is blank. 'I don't see her,' the sheriff says. 'If she's still alive, she'd tell me right then.' This man is not a witness, but he is a defendant in the case. The police have turned it over to Judge Scott. The county attorney says he might not appeal. 'No.' The sheriff turns to the lawyer, who is standing next to him.

"The diner's regulars eye you suspiciously: Old Pete nursing his coffee, Jenny the postal worker, and a man in a flannel shirt who hasn't spoken to anyone","Marge sets down your coffee with steady hands. 'Sarah was a good girl, kept to herself mostly. Though lately, she'd been asking strange questions about the town's history, you know my cousin worked at the library back in '89 when that whole thing happened with the government people.'","The Old Man: The old man's a tough guy, and it's not like he's a really good guy to be sitting by.

The Doctor: This man is the Doctor's closest friend. It's almost like he's the one to get you out of the room. Sometimes he'll ask you to give him a hug and then you'd like to go home. He's also the one to tell you to find your mate somewhere. It's almost like he's the one you need to tell to get through with the next guy. He's the one with the blue collar and the red scarf.

The Doctor: It's pretty funny how they don't talk much about the town's past. It's like they don't talk about that, because they're the ones who don't understand what's happened.

The Old Man: The doctor doesn't talk much about the town's past. It's like they don't talk about that, because they're the ones who don't understand what's happened.

"You discover Sarah's diary hidden behind books in the library, its pages filled with cryptic notes about 'the watchers' and 'the frequency'",The handwriting becomes increasingly erratic toward the final entries. 'They're always listening. The static on channel 7 isn't random. Someone is trying to communicate. The old radio tower on Owl Creek Road - that's where it's coming from.',"Sarah has a great deal of work to do to find the diary.

Naked Women: The first time Sarah and her sisters went to school with a group of friends I had a hard time believing that the girls would not be wearing anything to school for a week. I also knew that the girls were probably not really going to school with this much help from the school principal. We were very concerned that the girls would not be accepted into the school because they were so popular with the girls. Sarah and I both assumed that these girls were completely innocent and were just curious about what would happen if they were told to be in school. Finally I could see how Sarah and I felt that this sort of deception would never have worked, and that we weren't really going to be accepted into a school so we would just be put in this odd place where we didn't know the truth about what might happen. Sarah and I were very impressed with the school's way of doing things. Even though I didn't know anything about anyone else I was able to see how it all turned out. I learned a lot about the school and how it got to where I am today.

"At the abandoned radio tower, you find fresh tire tracks and disturbed earth around a sealed entrance","The concrete structure looms against the darkening sky, its antenna array still intact. Your radio crackles with strange interference. Through the static, you swear you hear... voices. Or maybe it's just the wind through the pines.","The ""Lost Child"" is a story of grief, loss, and hope, about the lives and deaths of children who were abducted by supernatural forces while boarding a bus in Georgia last June.

The story was told by a group of eight children in the fall of 1979 on the Eastern Front between the British and French armies. The children survived, but the children were kidnapped and driven to Europe in a desperate attempt to find peace.

The children of the children have been described as a large family, as many as ten or twelve. The majority of their stories are of love and kindness, and are full of humor and self-sacrifice. The children are said to show a healthy love for their parents and that they have been adopted and raised without violence. The story is told with a smile and a strong sense of wonder.

The story is told of a group of seven orphans who fell in love with a young man who lived with them until they were twelve years old, and then died of natural causes. The boy's parents had been convicted of child murder, and were sentenced to years of hard labor. A few years later, a young woman named Toni was brought to the orphanage, and was reunited with her family.

"The mayor's office feels too warm, too bright, and Mayor Briggs seems nervous as he shuffles through papers","He forces a smile that doesn't reach his eyes. 'Detective, welcome to Pine Hollow! Beautiful town, very quiet. This business with the Chen girl is... unfortunate. Probably just ran off to the city. Young people do that sometimes.'","Briggs smiles. 'But a little girl, she's not a bad person. She really is.' He looks at her. 'I love her. I don't see the danger. She's my daughter.' He smiles. 'She's your daughter. I'll take care of you as long as you're my daughter.' He takes a sip from his water and then starts mumbling something. 'I know that you might be feeling a little bit too young. And I'm sorry I didn't say that before. I just don't know this town. My sister's dying. My brother's going to be very ill. And I don't know any of that.' He looks at her in his mind. This is what he would do. He might be right. Briggs smiles. 'I can't tell - I know she can't. I just don't know. She might not have anything right now, but I feel... uneasy. I think it makes me feel like nothing I have done is wrong. That's why I'm here. I want to help.' He looks at his phone. He can hear the phone. It's from the Bureau of Land Management.

She came asking about the experiments. Said she found documents. They took her, same as they took the others back then. The government boys in their black cars.'","Now that his voice is almost as old as the glass, The old man's voice rises even louder in his mind, his face a cold, grimy look in the way his glasses are parted. 'Why didn't we give you the papers, right?' He says. 'You took them from Pete. We don't know who they are, but we have to give you documents back right now.' The older man shrugs in a way that suggests he has been doing this all along. 'I need a job then. I need the money. I need a job at the museum. I'm going to have to pay for the museum.'""

After the movie, when The Old Red Shoes opens, it is a few weeks before she gets any of the documents from the government. She will never know whether or not they were actually written by Pete, he tells me, ""or if they were written by others.""

She also tells me the truth about her own story. She met Pete while he was researching for a book called The Red Shoes.
