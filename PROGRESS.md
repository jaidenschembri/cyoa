## 🚧 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### 🔴 High Priority Risks
1. **Model Size vs. Performance**: Large models may not fit in memory
   - *Mitigation*: Start with smaller models, use gradient checkpointing

2. **Story Quality**: Generated content may be incoherent
   - *Mitigation*: Implement strong evaluation metrics, human review

### 🟡 Medium Priority Risks
1. **Training Time**: Long training could impact development speed
   - *Mitigation*: Use pre-trained models, efficient fine-tuning

2. **Data Bias**: Limited scenarios may not generalize
   - *Mitigation*: Continuous dataset expansion, diverse scenarios

## 📝 Development Notes

### 💡 Lessons Learned
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Keep cells simple, avoid complex markdown in code cells
- **MLflow**: Artifact logging works great for dataset versioning
- **Git Workflow**: Commit early and often with descriptive messages
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README saves time later

### 🔧 Best Practices Established
- Use PowerShell commands consistently (Windows environment)
- Log all data transformations as MLflow artifacts
- Include both original and processed data in experiments
- Document issues and resolutions for future reference
